/**
 * Phase 7o s4 follow-up — the Focus Mode exit is ALWAYS VISIBLE.
 *
 * The stage shipped a structural promise: the exit renders whenever the mode is
 * on, in no dialog and in no trap. Themis found two ways the "always" was
 * false anyway, both purely about LAYER — the promise was made in the DOM tree
 * and never checked in the stacking order:
 *
 * 1. The exit sat at z-[60], ABOVE the modal tier (z-50), so it painted over
 *    the backdrops of ConfirmDialog, ConsentModal, PrivacyPolicy, DataSyncModal,
 *    ComparisonModal, the field customizer and the tutorial. Chrome floating
 *    over a modal's scrim is the visible half; the other half is that it
 *    contradicts the rule the design already reasons about — a modal owns
 *    Escape and owns the screen while it is up.
 *
 * 2. StlPreview's fullscreen / toolpath overlay sat at z-[100], above the exit,
 *    so it obscured AND intercepted it. That overlay is reachable while Focus
 *    Mode is on precisely because the mode forces activeTab: "calculator" —
 *    StlPreview is mounted by MaterialSection, inside the calculator. It is
 *    not a permanent trap (the overlay owns Escape and has its own toggle), but
 *    the guarantee as written did not hold.
 *
 * The fix is a scale, not a nudged number. `tokens.css` already owned
 * `--z-dropdown`, so this file joins that scale rather than inventing a second
 * one, and consumes it the way `Select` already does (inline
 * `style={{ zIndex: "var(--z-…)" }}`) so the ordering is assertable here and
 * not only by reading class names.
 *
 * These tests drive the REAL StlPreview portal. Mocking it away is exactly the
 * mistake that let defect 2 through: a test that deletes the overlay proves
 * nothing about what the overlay does to the stacking order.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * Deriving the z-50 audit's own inputs, so the derivation is testable
 * instead of being a regex buried in an assertion.
 *
 * Two defects, both LOWs from the PR #233 review, both in how this file
 * works out what it is auditing:
 *
 * 1. The file list was derived with `/class(?:Name)?=[^\n]*\bz-50\b/`, which
 *    requires `z-50` to sit on the SAME LINE as `className=`. A class string
 *    written across several lines — which prettier produces without complaint
 *    once it gets long, and which five of the covered files already do for the
 *    part after `bg-black/60` — puts the token somewhere the heuristic cannot
 *    see. Such a file is never discovered, so it never reaches the covered-set
 *    assertion, so the audit silently stops auditing it. An unlisted file is
 *    the one case this test exists to catch, and the derivation was the hole.
 *
 *    The fix is to scan the file TEXT for the token instead of for a
 *    same-line shape. That is only sound with comments stripped, because a
 *    comment is not a class string: this tree discusses `z-50` in prose in five
 *    files that do not paint it (Toast, FocusModeExit, FieldCustomizer,
 *    InventoryDeductionCard, MobileNav — all of them explaining why they are
 *    NOT at z-50), and a raw text scan would list all five as unpinned and send
 *    the audit chasing its own documentation.
 *
 * 2. The sheet panel was recognised by `z-50[^\n]*rounded-t-2xl` — a
 *    COSMETIC proxy. Any unrelated floating box rounded at the top and filed in
 *    the modal tier passes as a legitimate panel, and pairing was only checked
 *    per FILE, so a panel in one file could be "answered" by a backdrop in the
 *    same file that has nothing to do with it. Both real panels are
 *    `fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 z-50 … rounded-t-2xl`: the load-bearing
 *    token is `bottom-0`, which is what makes it a bottom SHEET rather than a
 *    floating box, so that is what the pattern now requires. The pairing check
 *    becomes `panels <= backdrops`, which bounds the count rather than merely
 *    testing that a backdrop exists somewhere in the file.
 *
 * The classifier below reproduces the previous counts EXACTLY on all 14 covered
 * files — verified before it was written in, because a narrowing that silently
 * changed a number would be a weakening wearing a fix's clothes.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/**
 * Defect 3 — a PASSIVE surface buried the exit.
 *
 * Moving the exit from `z-[60]` down to `--z-shell-chrome` fixed the scrim
 * half of the first defect and opened this one: at `z-50` the Toast was the
 * modal TIER, and the modal tier sits above shell chrome by design. The toast
 * is not a modal. It is `role="region"` — no scrim, no focus trap, it does not
 * own Escape, and it dismisses itself after 4s — and `escapeIsOwnedByOverlay`
 * does not even match it, so nothing in the model treated it as a layer at
 * all. It inherited the one tier whose whole justification is "this surface
 * owns the screen", and the exit inherited the consequence.
 *
 * At `sm+` the two are pixel-identical: Toast anchors `sm:top-4 sm:right-4`,
 * the exit anchors `sm:top-4 sm:right-4`. The toast therefore painted
 * directly over the only way out of the mode, and covered it for four
 * seconds. It is reachable: `Calculator.tsx` mounts `ToastContainer` on the
 * calculator surface and Focus Mode forces `activeTab: "calculator"`.
 *
 * The root cause is not the number. It is that one tier admitted both
 * scrim-owning modals AND passive transients, so a surface that owns nothing
 * could inherit the right to cover the only thing that must stay reachable.
 * Passive surfaces get their own step, under shell chrome, and the modal tier

 * Defect 4 — the guided tour is an OWNING surface, and the rule said it was not.
 *
 * The tour is a scrim (`rgba(0,0,0,0.6)`, click-to-dismiss) with a card the user
 * is meant to answer: it has a scrim, it takes a click, and it takes Escape
 * (`finishTutorial()`, Tutorial.tsx:504). By ownership that puts it in the same
 * class as a scrim modal, so it is CORRECT for it to sit above the exit, and
 * correct for the exit to yield while it is up.
 *
 * What was wrong was the rule text, which claimed the tooltip was "the one
 * surface allowed above shell chrome" and that "anything clickable" was
 * forbidden there. 55 and 56 are above 45, and the tour card is clickable. The
 * rule was describing a tree it did not match, which is how a second hole got
 * in after the first was closed.
 *
 * `App.tsx:93` mounts the tutorial outside the Focus Mode guard on purpose, and
 * `App.focusMode.test.tsx` pins that — but it pins it with a MOCK
 * (`Tutorial: () => <div data-testid="tutorial" />`), so what it actually
 * asserts is that the component is still mounted, never that a scrim exists.
 * The decision stands, unchanged; these tests are what finally exercise it. A
 * keyboard user, with no focus trap to stop them, can Tab to the
 * FocusModeButton and press Enter mid-tour — the sequence modelled here.
