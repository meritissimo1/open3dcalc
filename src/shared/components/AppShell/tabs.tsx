/**
 * Navigation surfaces and the Phase 7o s3 primary/demoted split (V2.0).
 *
 * `Tab` is the surface contract: it is the vocabulary every platform, the tab
 * → surface switch and the tutorial registry already speak, and it is
 * unchanged by this phase. What changed is which surfaces are *primary
 * destinations* (the five in `PRIMARY_TABS`, rendered in the nav bar) versus
 * *demoted* surfaces (the five in `MORE_TABS`, still fully functional and
 * reachable through the "More" disclosure).
 *
 * The five primary destinations are the existing surface ids under
 * product-facing names: calculator→Pricing, dashboard→Dashboard,
 * history→History, catalog→Printers, inventory→Spools. Infill is demoted, not
 * removed — its standalone screen and its in-calculator field are untouched.
 *
 * `TABS` stays the full ordered catalog (primary first, then demoted) and is
 * locked by tabsParity.test (web ≡ desktop ≡ TUTORIAL_TABS) — keep all three in
 * sync. Wiki and Novidades are footer-only surfaces and are intentionally not
 * part of this array.
